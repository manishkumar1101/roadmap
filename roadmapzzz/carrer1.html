    <h2>Let's divide the job search process into 4 stages:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching for and applying to jobs</li>
        <li>Getting your resume shortlisted</li>
        <li>Clearing interviews</li>
        <li>Getting an offer letter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's look at what do you need to do at each of these stages.</p>
        <p> Note that each of these require significant work that needs to be done way before the job search process starts. Details about those are also mentioned below.</p>
    <h2>Searching for and applying to jobs</h2>
    <ul>
        <!-- i should add link of that pages -->
        <li><a href="">How to apply for off-campus placements (jobs/internships)?</a></li>
        <li><a href="">How to get job referrals on LinkedIn?</a></li>
        <li><a href="">How to get a recruiter's attention on LinkedIn?</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting your resume shortlisted</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Since most job openings receive 100s to 1000s of applications, it is not possible for a company to interview everyone who applies.</li>
        <li>To reduce the number of interviews, Recruiters and Hiring Managers shortlist only those resumes which stand out or matches the most to the job roles.</li>
        <li>Having common basic projects on your resume or having a 3* rating on CodeChef is still better than having nothing related to programming. But note that these things won't help you stand out as 50% of the applicants would have the same thing.</li>
        <li>Few things that can help your resume stand out:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Good ranks in programming contests</li>
            <!-- add link -->
            <li><a href="">Demoeable projects that actually solve a problem and whose code is not easily available on the internet</a></li>
            <li>Decent open-source contribution</li>
            <li>Good research work</li>
            <li>Being from a Tier-1 college. Not much within your control.</li>
            <li>Having worked at a big tech company previously. Not applicable for freshers.</li>
        </ol>
