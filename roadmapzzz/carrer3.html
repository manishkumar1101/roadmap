        <h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Good at most of the things in software engineering.</li>
            <li>Yet to build expertise in any field</li>
            <li>Projects for learning and resume
            </li>
            <li>Set for good placements
            </li>
            <li>Irrespective of college or branch
            </li>
        </ul>   
        <h3>Expectations</h3><br>
        <p>These three things are most important to do well in any field:        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consistency
            </li>
            <li>Hard Work
            </li>
            <li>Right Direction
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>This roadmap will help you provide the right direction but you need to put in hard work consistently to achieve what you want to.</p>
        <br><p>Assumption: Avg. 2.4 hours/day (2 hrs/day on weekdays; 3.5 hrs/day on weekends)</p>
        <br><p>Total Commitment:</p>
        <br><ul><li>
            44 weeks/734 hours (~1 year) for Foundations and Intermediate
        </li>
        <li>After 1 year: Avg. 2.4 hours/day for Learning, Interview Prep, and Side-Projects</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>We will try to become good at everything within 1 year with a consistent effort of around 2.5 hours/day. After that, we will try to become experts in at least one field. If you want, you can adjust the daily time commitment based on your preference.</p>
   <br> <p>If you follow this well then irrespective of your college and your branch, you will be able to get a job in any company that you want.    </p>
 <br>  <h1>Foundations (22 weeks; 366 hours)</h1> <br>
 <h2>Learn to code (6 weeks; 100 hours)</h2>
 <br><p>Learn to code in any language of your choice with a strong focus on foundations. You should aim to become extremely comfortable in coding. If youâ€™re told the high-level logic, you should be able to code it without much thinking. </p>
<br><p>A good practice while learning to code is to think about everything logically rather than in terms of code.  </p>
<br><h2>Suggested roadmap
</h2>
<br>
<p>We highly recommend learning C and C++ followed by learning about object-orientation and then transitioning to Java. Starting with C will help cover all major programming concepts. It will be very easy to move to any high-level language (like C++, Java, Python, Javascript, etc) quite easily if you know C. Though you can directly learn Java or any other high-level language as well if you want to.</p>
<br><h2>Learn programming concepts through C (4 weeks; 70 hours)</h2>
<br>
<p>During this phase, focus on learning different programming concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Input and output</li>
    <li>Variables and data types</li>
    <li>Operators</li>
    <li>Decision making (if-else statements)</li>
    <li>Loops (for, while, do-while)</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Understanding these concepts will provide a strong foundation for your programming journey.</p>
<p>While learning the language, write a lot of code for whatever you are learning to retain the syntax and the various concepts. Solve a good number of problems where you can use these concepts. This will help you get a hold of the syntax.</p>
<h2>Learn about object-orientation (3 days; 6 hours)</h2>
<p>This will require you to code in C++ (which is just C with object-orientation). Learn about classes and objects (including constructor), encapsulation (including public and private access specifiers, this pointer and getters and setters), and the static keyword. You do not need to learn any other OOP concept at this stage.</p>

<h2>Transition to Java (12 days; 24 hours)</h2>
<p>Once you know the common programming concepts and have an idea about classes and objects, you can learn Java pretty easily. Learn exception handling as well.</p>

<p>You do not need to learn multithreading or any other advanced concepts at this stage. You just need to learn to write code in Java.</p>

<p>Convert your previously created solutions from C/C++ to Java. This will help you get a hold of Java syntax.</p>

<h2>Become a power computer user (3 weeks; 50 hours)</h2>
<p>Google is your friend. Learn how to get answers (keep improving forever)</p>
<p>One of the most important skills that you need to have. Try to become a power google user. Most of the issues that you face will not be new or unique. Your friend Google already knows how to fix it.</p>

<p>Whenever you are learning something and have a doubt, Google for the specific doubt/error. Do not search for anything that is very broad. Try to get to the specifics.</p>

<h2>Learn regular expression (4 days; 10 hours)</h2>
<p>This is an extremely useful skill that you should have at your fingertips. Learn the basics of regular expression (language-agnostic). Practice the learned concepts in Java (or any language that you know).</p>

<h2>Become an expert in Data Structures & Algorithms (17 weeks; 284 hours)</h2>
<p>Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) is one of the most foundational topics in Computer Science and is the most important topic for interviews. Job interviews require you to solve problems in the best possible manner by applying your DSA knowledge. For interview prep, the number of problems you solve does not matter a lot. Being a good problem-solver matter.</p>

<p>There are many topics in DSA. Implement everything covered in these topics and in parallel, try to solve a few questions related to the topics that you are learning. If you understand DSA well, you can easily become an expert with some practice. You should start by learning how to calculate the time and space complexity of a solution. Many people avoid this step and face difficulty in optimizing their solutions.</p>

<p>Topics to learn and practice:</p>

<ul>
    <li>DSA Foundations (Time & Space Complexity Analysis, Recursion, Divide & Conquer) (1.5 weeks; 25 hours)</li>
    <li>Basic DSA (Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Searching, Sorting) (3 weeks; 51 hours)</li>
    <li>Basic Algorithms (Hashing, 2 pointers, Backtracking) (2 weeks; 33 hours)</li>
    <li>Basic Maths for Programming (1.5 weeks; 25 hours)</li>
    <li>Intermediate Algorithms (String Manipulation & Bit Manipulation) (1.5 weeks; 25 hours)</li>
    <li>Intermediate Data Structures (Trees, Set, Map, Heap) (3 weeks; 50 hours)</li>
    <li>Advanced Algorithms (Greedy, DP) (2.5 weeks; 42 hours)</li>
    <li>Graph DSA (2 weeks; 33 hours)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practice and Build Expertise (at least until getting a job)</h2>

<p>You must continue doing the following until your interviews and potentially after that as well if you like doing it.</p>

<p>This will help you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>prepare a solid resume</li>
    <li>prepare for interviews</li>
    <li>build expertise</li>
</ul>

<h2>DSA Interview Preparation [Very Important]</h2>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of DSA, regularly solve problems on LeetCode or InterviewBit. Try to do this regularly until you get a job.</p>

<p>You may start with a low frequency (7 hours/week). Increase the frequency as you get closer to interviews (30+ hours/week) depending on your comfort and preparation.</p>

<p>You should aim to master applying DSA concepts to almost any medium to hard problems on the above platforms.</p>

<h3>Build side-projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Be consistent: Keep building side projects regularly. Preferably end-to-end.</p></li>
<li><p>Start small: Start with smaller projects and move to bigger projects with time.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a team: Involve multiple people to work as a team. Try to get a designer as well on the team.</p></li>
<li><p>Build clones: Try to build specific features from commonly-used apps/websites.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a startup: Think of business ideas and try to build them.</p></li>
<li><p>Open-Source: Publish the projects on GitHub (if the side-project is not a potential startup).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Peer-to-peer mock interviews</h2>
<p>Do peer-to-peer mock interviews with your friends or with other job-seekers on Pramp. Start by doing a mock interview every 2 months, increase the frequency to more than once a week closer to your interviews.</p>

<h2>Build expertise</h2>
<p>If you do all the things well mentioned till now, you can get a job/internship quite comfortably. But why stop at this when we can be an expert in one or more fields. Everything that we do beyond this will help us become sought-after engineers in the long term. You can read about how to build expertise in the next part.</p>
